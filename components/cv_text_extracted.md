  
I am a cybersecurity professional with an engineering background, driven by a strong interest in understanding how
complex systems fail and how they can be secured against real-world threats. My motivation to work in cybersecurity
comes from a genuine curiosity about technology, infrastructure and human behaviour, and from a constant need to
analyse, document and improve the systems I work with.
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have naturally gravitated towards hands-on technical work,
combining security engineering, automation and offensive security practice. I enjoy environments where careful
analysis, attention to detail and structured methodologies are valued, and where security decisions must be both
technically sound and operationally realistic.
I am particularly interested in offensive security and Red Team activities, as they bring together deep technical
knowledge, strategic thinking and creativity. At the same time, my engineering mindset leads me to design tools,
automations and workflows that improve efficiency, reliability and security over time.
Comfortable working in multidisciplinary and international environments, I value clear communication, documentation
and collaboration, and I am motivated by contributing to organisations where security plays a critical role in protecting
data, services and people.
I want to compromise your systems before others do.

Offensive Security Training Path 
My current professional objective is to obtain the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification within
the next year, as a natural progression towards advanced offensive security and Red Team roles.
As part of this journey, I am actively preparing for and planning to sit the CJCA (Certified Junior Cybersecurity Analyst)
and CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist) certifications from Hack The Box. These intermediate certifications
are intentionally chosen to continuously assess and validate my practical skill level during the OSCP preparation
process.
Given my ongoing hands-on practice solving real-world Hack The Box CTFs, I consider HTB’s training paths and
certifications the most accurate and relevant benchmarks to objectively measure my offensive security capabilities
before attempting OSCP.
This approach allows me to maintain a structured, skills-driven progression focused on real exploitation techniques,
Active Directory attacks, privilege escalation and operational security.
Offensive Security 
Hands-on experience in offensive security through continuous resolution of real-world Hack The Box CTFs, working
primarily from Kali Linux. Proficient with core offensive tooling such as Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, John the Ripper,
Nessus, Maltego, and extensive use of Impacket-based tools (smbclient, smbmap, CrackMapExec, WinRM).
Strong focus on Active Directory attacks, including user enumeration, NTLM hash extraction, and advanced techniques
such as Silver Ticket and Golden Ticket attacks. Solid understanding of lateral movement and privilege escalation,
supported by tools like BloodHound, Neo4j, LinPEAS, and manual analysis.
Web security experience includes directory traversal, RCE, SQL injection, XSS, LFI, SSTI and buffer overflow
fundamentals, using tools such as OWASP ZAP, Nikto, WPScan, Gobuster and SQLMap. Currently operating at an
intermediate level, prioritizing deep analysis and methodology over speed, with the ability to solve machines without
external writeups.
Security Engineering, IAM & Data Governance 
Security engineer role focused on Identity and Access Management (IAM) and data governance within a large-scale
government enterprise data platform. Responsible for user lifecycle management, permissions governance and access
control across Databricks, ensuring compliance with ENS and GDPR.
PROJECTS 
ACTIVE TRAINING & PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
SKILLS 
Daily work includes securing secrets, tokens and credentials across Azure, Databricks, AWS and data visualization
platforms such as Power BI, following least-privilege and segregation-of-duties principles.
Designed and implemented advanced security automations, including:
• A Neo4j-based access graph built in Python using PyVis, querying the Databricks SCIM API every 30 minutes to
visualize relationships between users, groups, service principals and data assets, enabling permission path
analysis and access impact validation.
• Automated environment provisioning using structured Python-based permission and group templates, reducing
a full day of manual IAM configuration to minutes through repeatable, auditable deployments.
Cloud Platforms & Infrastructure 
Administrator-level experience in Microsoft Azure, managing users, identities, machines and access controls to prevent
unauthorized data exposure.
Early-stage involvement in AWS environment deployments, contributing to the initial setup and security configuration.
Experience deploying and maintaining personal and professional projects on Railway and Vercel, with solid
understanding of API integrations, credential management, web security fundamentals and data storage architectures.
Programming & Security Automation 
Daily use of Python, Bash, PowerShell and SQL for security operations, automation and data access management.
Development of custom tooling and scripts for IAM enforcement, permissions auditing, deployment automation and
security workflows. Additional projects and tooling are publicly documented in GitHub and the personal portfolio.
AI, Data & Advanced Engineering 
Practical use of LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) and local models via Ollama, combined with a strong academic
foundation in neural networks and signal-based entropy generation.
Applied AI to cybersecurity workflows, including:
• Automated generation of technical writeups using n8n pipelines, transforming structured notes into high-quality
reports with manual review and refinement.
• Experimental local models that analyze command output (e.g., Nmap scans) to suggest attack paths, highlight
interesting services and recall previously observed vulnerabilities.
• AI is used as an augmentation tool, not a replacement, with a medium but focused weight in the overall skill set.
Methodology & Professional Mindset 
Highly structured and analytical working style, with strong emphasis on documentation, evidence collection and clear
reporting for both technical and non-technical audiences.
Known for maintaining efficiency under high workloads, prioritizing tasks by impact and deadlines, and working calmly
in complex environments.
Hybrid profile combining engineering mindset and Red Team orientation, with a long-term objective to operate in
advanced Red Team environments while continuing to design tools and automations that improve efficiency, reliability
and security outcomes.
